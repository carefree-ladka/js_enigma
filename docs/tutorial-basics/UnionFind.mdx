# Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Tutorial

## Introduction

The Union-Find data structure, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two primary operations:

1. **Union**: Merge two subsets into a single subset.
2. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in.

Union-Find is particularly useful in scenarios involving network connectivity, Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, and various other graph-related problems.

## Key Operations

1. **Find**: This operation determines the representative or root of the set that contains the given element. Path compression is often used to speed up future queries.

2. **Union**: This operation merges two subsets into a single subset. Union by rank (or size) is commonly used to keep the tree flat and efficient.

## Implementation

Here’s a basic implementation of the Union-Find data structure in JavaScript:

```javascript
class UnionFind {
  constructor(size) {
    this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
    this.rank = Array(size).fill(0);
  }

  // Find the root of the set containing element x with path compression
  find(x) {
    if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
      this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]); // Path compression
    }
    return this.parent[x];
  }

  // Union the sets containing elements x and y with union by rank
  union(x, y) {
    const rootX = this.find(x);
    const rootY = this.find(y);

    if (rootX !== rootY) {
      // Union by rank
      if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
      } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
      } else {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        this.rank[rootX] += 1;
      }
    }
  }
}

// Example Usage
const uf = new UnionFind(10);

// Union operations
uf.union(1, 2);
uf.union(2, 3);
uf.union(4, 5);

// Find operations
console.log(uf.find(1)); // Output: 1 (root of the set containing 1)
console.log(uf.find(3)); // Output: 1 (root of the set containing 3)
console.log(uf.find(5)); // Output: 5 (root of the set containing 5)
