## In-Place Reversal of a Linked List

Reversing a linked list in-place involves reversing the direction of the pointers in the list without using additional data structures. This technique is useful for operations requiring efficient space usage and is commonly used in various linked list problems.

### Concept

In an in-place reversal, each node's `next` pointer is updated to point to its previous node. This process is performed iteratively or recursively.

### Iterative Approach

The iterative approach involves three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next`. By iterating through the list and adjusting the pointers, the list can be reversed.

**Code Example**:

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(value = 0, next = null) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

/**
 * Reverse a linked list in-place iteratively.
 * @param {ListNode} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @return {ListNode} - The new head of the reversed linked list.
 */
const reverseListIterative = (head) => {
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;

  while (current) {
    const next = current.next; // Save next node
    current.next = prev;       // Reverse the pointer
    prev = current;            // Move prev to current node
    current = next;            // Move to next node
  }

  return prev; // New head of the reversed list
};
```

### Recursive Approach

```Javascript
/**
 * Reverse a linked list in-place recursively.
 * @param {ListNode} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @return {ListNode} - The new head of the reversed linked list.
 */
const reverseListRecursive = (head) => {
  // Base case: empty list or single node
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return head;
  }

  // Recursively reverse the rest of the list
  const newHead = reverseListRecursive(head.next);

  // Update pointers
  head.next.next = head;
  head.next = null;

  return newHead;
};
```
